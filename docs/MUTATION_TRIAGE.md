# Mutation triage: the survivor loop

A surviving mutant is one of exactly two things:

- an **equivalent mutant** — semantically identical to the original, therefore
  unkillable, genuine noise; or
- a **test gap** — real, and the whole point of running mutation testing.

Without a persistent record of adjudicated equivalents, every re-sweep
re-presents the same noise and the loop never converges. This document is the
convention that makes it converge, plus the two rules that stop it converging
on a lie.

Everything here is enforced by tooling, not by good intentions: `just
mutants-gates` is blocking inside `just verify`. (`just mutant-schema-neutral`
is blocking too, but only in this tool's own repo — it guards the neutral core
against learning a generator's vocabulary, and a project that installs the
binary has no such core to violate.)

---

## 1. The loop

```
just mutants-preflight <crate>     # seconds — refuse a sweep whose tests never run
just mutants -p <crate>            # hours — the sweep itself, serially, off-hours
just mutants-triage <crate>        # the classified report; the ONLY thing an agent reads
    ├── equivalent → just mutants-admit ...   (gated on two refutations)
    └── test gap   → just mutants-bead-draft ...  then a bead, then a test,
                     then just mutants-kill  ← the only thing that closes it
```

Exit codes from `just mutants-triage`:

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | converged — no new survivors and no stale claims |
| `2` | adjudication needed |
| `3` | understood and declined: an untrustworthy sweep, an invalid scope, or a ledger write its evidence does not carry |
| `1` | tool error |

### Convergence means *every* census mutant reached a conclusion

Exit `0` requires an empty survivor list, an empty stale list, **no timeouts,
and no unevaluated mutants**. A `TIMEOUT` is never conclusive and a census
entry the run did not reach is not a result, so either one keeps the run open.
The alternative is a sweep that exits `0` with 154 of 155 mutants untested.

Triage therefore reads the crate's **full census** (`just mutants-census`, a
`--list` with no build), never `mutants.out/mutants.json`. Both files in
`mutants.out/` are rewritten by every `just mutants` run, *including* the
narrowed kill-verification re-run this loop mandates — so triaging against them
asks "did everything the last run happened to select get killed?" and answers
yes. Measured: a one-mutant re-run left artefacts reading `1 mutants, 1 killed,
converged` for a 21-mutant crate; against the full census the same artefacts
read `21 mutants, 1 killed, 20 unevaluated`, exit 2.

### What a sweep never sees

A sweep can only speak for the mutants the generator produced, and
cargo-mutants never looks inside three kinds of item: a method or trait method
named `new`, anything in an `impl Default`, and an `unsafe fn`. The rule is
hard-coded in its visitor, with no option to turn it off. Nothing inside them
reaches the census, so nothing there can survive or be killed, and a crate
whose validating constructors are all wrong converges exactly like one whose
constructors are right.

Triage therefore lists every such item whose body decides something — it
branches, loops, returns early with `?`, or applies an operator — under
`unexamined` (NEVER EXAMINED in the text report), with the generator's reason.
An item that only builds a value is left out: it had nothing to mutate but its
return value. So is code excluded on purpose, test code and
`#[mutants::skip]`.

The list never keeps a run open. No re-sweep can change it, so gating on it
would make convergence unreachable; exit `0` is a verdict on the census, and
this list is what the census does not cover. Prove each entry by hand: a
property test over its rule, and a hand-made mutation of it that the test
must catch.

`just mutants-census` writes the generator's own listing of the files it walks
(`--list-files --json`) beside the census, and `triage --files` reads it. Every
file the census holds a mutant in must be in that listing. One that is not was
written for another package or tree, and triage stops with an error rather
than report somebody else's blind spots.

### `--iterate` and the ledger are not the same thing

`--iterate` shrinks **compile time**: it skips mutants already caught in a
previous run. The ledger shrinks **judgment time**: it subtracts mutants
already adjudicated equivalent. Neither replaces the other.

> **`--iterate` is currently incompatible with the convergence contract.** Its
> whole point is to leave previously-caught mutants out of the artefacts, and
> this triage counts a census mutant with no verdict as unevaluated — so an
> `--iterate`d re-sweep can never report convergence, and one whose remaining
> mutants all survive is refused outright as `NothingKilled`. Reconciling the
> two needs the previous run's verdicts carried forward. Tracked in
> `pipe-cli-mutants-iterate-convergence-rjw`. Until then: do not pass `--iterate`.

## 2. Identity: why the key looks like that

```
key := <path> "::" <item> " @" <site> " " <class> ":" <from> "->" <to> " #" <occ>
```

Worked, from a live census:

```
crates/pipeline/pipeline-domain/src/projection.rs::current_phase @4ac941eb matchguard:s == stage->true #0
```

**No line numbers, anywhere.** A key that carried one would be invalidated by
every unrelated edit above it in the file, and a ledger whose entries expire
on unrelated edits is a ledger nobody trusts. `docs/0002-mutant-identity-by-holed-site-anchor.md`
has the measurement that settled it.

Every component is re-derived from the **current source text** by our own
`syn`-based normalizer:

| component | what it is |
|---|---|
| `path` | workspace-root-relative, forward slashes |
| `item` | the `::`-joined chain of enclosing `mod` / `impl` / `trait` / `fn`, generics erased, a trait impl spelled `Type#Trait` |
| `site` | `sha256(anchor_text)[..8]`, where the mutated span is replaced by the hole marker `‹›`, comments dropped, whitespace runs collapsed |
| `class` | one of `binop`, `unop`, `fnvalue`, `matcharm`, `matchguard`, `structfield` — a closed set |
| `from` | the normalized tokens **read from the source at the span** |
| `to` | the normalized replacement; `∅` when the replacement is empty |
| `occ` | 0-based rank inside a group that is otherwise identical, ordered by span start, computed by our own sort |

`from` is load-bearing, not decorative. A replacement alone does not identify a
mutation: `(report.rs, Verification::from_votes, BinaryOperator, "<")` matched
two distinct mutants in one measured crate.

### The anchor table

The site anchor is chosen by a **closed table on span kind**, not a generic
"smallest enclosing node" rule:

| mutated span | anchor |
|---|---|
| is, or is inside, a match-arm **guard** | arm pattern + `if` + holed guard. **The arm body is excluded** — editing an arm body must not invalidate a guard claim |
| **is** a whole match arm | the arm's pattern tokens, un-holed |
| **is** a whole function body | the function signature including its return type |
| is inside an `if` / `while` / `match` condition or scrutinee | the holed condition |
| is inside a `const` / `static` initializer | the holed declaration |
| otherwise | the smallest enclosing statement, holed |

One documented exception to "`from` is the tokens at the span": for a
`fnvalue` mutation the span is the *entire function body*. Inlining a body into
a key would make it unreadable and would invalidate it on any body edit, even
though the anchor is deliberately the signature. So `from` carries the
source-derived **return type** instead — `fnvalue:Option<ExecutionPhase>->None`.
Uniqueness still comes from `to`, which is distinct per replacement.

### Three scopes of invalidation

| edit | effect |
|---|---|
| inside the anchor | `site` changes → the mutant comes back as **NEW**. Correct: the claim was about that anchor |
| elsewhere in the same item | the key is intact but `item_digest` mismatches → **`StaleClaim`: NOT subtracted**, shown with the old justification and refutations attached |
| anywhere else | invisible to the key |

Re-affirming a stale claim requires a **fresh refutation record at a new
`tree_sha`**. Bumping the digest is not evidence, and `just mutants-reaffirm`
refuses to accept a record whose sha is already on file.

---

## 3. The ledger

`mutants-equivalence.toml` at the repo root, sibling to
`hex-lint-exceptions.toml` and for the same reason: a committed, reviewable
file of deliberate exceptions whose header states the rules a reviewer holds
the diff against.

**The ledger holds judgements, never computations.** Anything the pre-filter
re-derives each run — a vacuous mutation, an unviable one, one outside the
sweep's scope — is never written to it.

### A worked entry

```toml

### Closed enums

- `argument` ∈ `type-equivalent` · `guarded-unreachable` · `redundant-guard` ·
  `idempotent` · `unobservable-through-public-api` · `identical-tokens`
- `method` ∈ `test-written` · `impossible-by-construction`
- `impossible_because` ∈ `type-uninhabited` · `no-public-path` ·
  `identical-tokens` · `unreachable-by-type`
- `verdict` ∈ `killed` · `survived` · `timeout` · `unviable` — the **domain's**
  vocabulary, not any tool's console word. The first version compared a free
  string against one generator's spelling of "survived", hardcoded in the
  functional core, which made a refutation performed with any other runner
  permanently inadmissible
- `baseline` ∈ `green` · `red`
- `class` ∈ `binop` · `unop` · `fnvalue` · `matcharm` · `matchguard` · `structfield`
- `status` ∈ `active` · `revoked`

Each `argument` has a **standard of proof** the check enforces:

| argument | must bring |
|---|---|
| `type-equivalent`, `idempotent`, `unobservable-through-public-api` | a refutation with `method = "test-written"` — somebody tried to write the killing test |
| `guarded-unreachable`, `redundant-guard` | a refutation with `method = "impossible-by-construction"` — somebody showed the state unconstructible |
| `identical-tokens` | nothing: it is mechanically decidable, the pre-filter re-derives it every run, and it is **never admissible as a written entry** |

### What `ledger check` enforces

No sweep, no build. Blocking inside `just verify`.

1. `key == render(path, item, site, class, from, to, occurrence)`.
2. `justification` present, exactly one line, 60–400 characters after trim.
3. **Relevance** — the justification shares at least one identifier with the
   stored `snippet`.
4. **Banned boilerplate** (case-folded, punctuation-stripped): *equivalent*,
   *no behavioural change*, *trivial*, *obviously equivalent*,
   *same semantics*, *see above*.
5. **Anti-copy-paste** — a byte-identical justification across two different
   `item`s is an error. Allowed within one item.
6. `argument` in the enum, and it brings its standard of proof.
7. **Exactly two refutation records**, lenses `test-writer` and `semantics`,
   both `refuted = false`, with `by` values distinct from each other and from
   `claimed_by`.
8. `method = "test-written"` ⇒ `baseline == "green"`, `verdict == "survived"`,
   `test_source` holding a test — `#[test]`, a harness's own
   `#[<harness>::test]` (`#[hegel::test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, with or without
   arguments), or `proptest!` — and
   `test_committed == false`. Each of the other three verdicts is rejected with
   its own reason: `killed` **proves the claim false**, `timeout` is never
   conclusive, `unviable` is not evidence about tests.
9. `method = "impossible-by-construction"` ⇒ `impossible_because` in the enum.
   Prose alone is a schema error.
10. Every refutation's `tree_sha` is at least 7 hex characters **and resolves
    through `git cat-file`**. Unresolved it is a string, and re-affirmation —
    which refuses to repeat a sha already on record — degenerates into "supply
    a different string".
11. `status = "revoked"` ⇒ `revocation.by` resolves through `br show`, and
    `revocation.why` is non-empty.
12. No duplicate keys, **no unknown fields** (a typo must not silently disable
    a check), entries sorted by key, `schema == 1`.
13. The ledger **file exists**. An absent ledger is not an empty one: a bad
    rebase or a stray `git rm` would otherwise make the gate that protects the
    file report `0 entries OK` while every adjudication vanished.

Admission adds one rule the file cannot carry: **only a mutant that actually
SURVIVED may be claimed equivalent**, so `ledger admit` takes `--from` and
refuses a `timeout`, an `unviable` or a mutant with no verdict at all.

`just mutants-gates --census <list.json>` additionally reports dangling
entries — keys no mutant in that census matches. That is a sweep-loop check,
not part of `verify`.

### Revocation

A wrong entry is **revoked in place**, never deleted:

```toml
status = "revoked"

[equivalent.revocation]
by  = "pipe-cli-mutants-jq3.2.7"     # must be an existing bead id
at  = "a19f33c"
why = "br-xyz.3 added a direct entry point that bypasses the per-stage partition; the arm is now reachable with a foreign stage"
```

The tombstone is shown at triage so nobody re-adjudicates the same lie. Use
`just mutants-revoke '<key>' <bead> '<why>'`.

---

## 4. The classification convention

**Every remaining survivor is explicitly adjudicated. No survivor is left
unclassified.** There are two dispositions and no third:

- **equivalent** → a ledger entry with a one-line justification, admitted only
  through the two-refuter gate below;
- **test gap** → a bead describing the untested **behaviour** — *what*, not
  *how* — carrying the key and the kill command.

A survivor you have not reasoned about is a test gap. Uncertainty is never
evidence of equivalence: calling a test gap "equivalent" writes a permanent lie
into a committed ledger, while calling an equivalent a test gap only wastes
some time. The costs are not symmetric.

### Admission requires adversarial confirmation

An equivalence claim is admitted **only after two independent refuters have
each tried to refute it and failed**, through two different lenses
(`test-writer` and `semantics`). One agent's plausible verdict is not evidence.

The measurement behind this rule: arXiv:2501.12862 (ACH, Meta) scored an
LLM-based equivalent-mutant detector at **precision 0.79** raw — one in five
"equivalent" claims was wrong. Deterministic preprocessing before the model
judged lifted it to 0.95. That is why this loop pre-filters mechanically first
and then makes every surviving claim face independent refutation.

`just mutants-admit` refuses without two well-formed refutations from two
agents, neither of whom is the claimant. The gate runs *before* the write, so a
bad entry never reaches the file.

### NEVER BULLDOZE

> **Writing a contorted test to kill an equivalent mutant asserts the
> implementation, not the spec. Do not do it.**

This is a rule, not a preference. A test that exists only to move a mutation
counter pins whatever the code currently happens to do, and the next person to
change the implementation correctly will have to delete it — after spending an
afternoon working out whether it was protecting anything.

If you wrote such a test while trying to refute a claim, that is exactly what
was supposed to happen: record it in the ledger as
`refutation.test_source` with `test_committed = false`. It is **evidence**, not
a test. `ledger check` rejects `test_committed = true`.

### Test-gap beads

Describe the **behaviour** that is untested, not the fix. `just mutants-bead-draft <crate> '<key>'`
prints the key, the site anchor, the re-run, and the question the bead has to
answer.

---

## 5. Kill verification

```
kill-verification: just mutants -p <crate> -f <path> -F '<regex>' --baseline skip
  FLAG TRAP 1: -f/--file FILTERS files, it does not SCOPE the run. Without
  -p the run resolves against Cargo.toml's default-members, so -f on a file
  outside them matches NOTHING -- and a run that matches nothing exits
  successfully having tested zero mutants, which reads as `everything killed`.
  FLAG TRAP 2: -F is an alias of --re, a mutant-NAME regex matched against
  --list names. -F is NOT the file flag.
  --baseline skip is valid ONLY immediately after a green `just test` on this tree.
  This bead closes ONLY when that re-run reports KILLED.
  "a test was added" is never evidence.
```

That block is printed at the foot of every `just mutants-triage` report and at
the head of every generated test-gap bead, from a single constant, so the doc
and the tool cannot drift apart.

**A test-gap bead closes only when re-running exactly that mutant reports
KILLED.** "A test was added" is never evidence: the test may not reach the
mutated line, may not assert on the differing value, or may be gated behind a
feature the run does not enable.

Verified against `cargo mutants --help` v27:

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-p`, `--package <PACKAGE>` | **scopes** the run to a package. Without it the run resolves against `default-members` |
| `-f`, `--file <FILE>` | glob **filtering** files inside whatever the run is already scoped to |
| `-F`, `--re <EXAMINE_RE>` | regex for **mutations** to examine, matched against the names `--list` shows |
| `-E`, `--exclude-re <EXCLUDE_RE>` | the inverse of `-F` |

`-f` is a filter, not a scope, and the difference is not academic. Measured
on this tree: `cargo mutants --list -f crates/sandbox-protocol/src/lib.rs`
selects **zero** mutants, because the run is still scoped to
`default-members = ["apps/pipe-cli"]` and that file is not in it. A run that
selects nothing exits *successfully* having tested nothing. The first
kill-verification command this loop ever generated did exactly that — which is
why the generated command now always carries `-p`, and why the scope guard
refuses a bare `-f`.

Three things make this mechanical instead of a warning in a document:

- **The command is generated.** `just mutants-kill <crate> '<key>'` builds it from the
  domain's `KillCommand`, so the escaping lives in one place. Real descriptions
  carry regex metacharacters — `replace += with -= in modal_class`,
  `delete match arm StageStatus::Running{..}`.
- **The regex omits `line:col`**, so a command pasted into a bead stays valid
  across unrelated edits. When the selected group has more than one member, the
  rule is "all members report KILLED".
- **Selection is asserted at render time.** `cargo mutants -F` matching nothing
  exits *successfully* having tested zero mutants — which reads as "everything
  killed", a false green sitting directly on the kill-verification rule.
  `just mutants-kill` refuses to print a command that selects nothing.

### The `--baseline skip` hazard

`--baseline skip` makes a single-mutant re-run cheap by skipping the unmutated
build and test. On a **red tree every mutant looks killed** — it is a
false-green factory.

The tools emit `--baseline skip` only when a green stamp exists at
`target/mutation-triage/green-<fingerprint>`, written by `just mutants-green`.
A sweep whose baseline was skipped is **refused** without that stamp.

Two details of the stamp are load-bearing, and both were wrong at first:

- It is keyed to a fingerprint of the **working tree** — the commit plus every
  uncommitted change plus the contents of untracked files
  (`scripts/hooks/tree-fingerprint.sh`) — not to `git rev-parse HEAD`. The sha
  does not move when you edit a file, and editing tests at one commit is this
  loop's entire activity, so a sha-keyed stamp survives every *failed* attempt
  at a fix and then authorises a baseline skip on a red tree.
- It is written by `just test-all`, not `just test`. `just mutants` pins
  `--all-features`, and a bare `--workspace --all-targets` silently drops every
  target whose `required-features` fall outside the default resolution — so a
  stamp from the weaker suite would authorise skipping the baseline of the
  stronger one.

### Timeouts

**A `TIMEOUT` verdict is never admissible.** On this machine it is a
measurement artifact, not a result. Timeouts are quarantined by the pre-filter
into a separate section of the report, never folded into KILLED or SURVIVED,
and never adjudicated. Re-run the mutant with a raised `--timeout` before
classifying it either way.

Three mechanisms enforce it, because the rule was written in three places and
enforced in none: a timeout keeps the run's exit code at `2`, `ledger admit`
refuses a mutant whose verdict is not `survived`, and `ledger check` rejects a
refutation carrying `verdict = "timeout"`.

### Unviable mutants get their own list

A mutant whose mutated tree did not compile is not evidence about tests, but it
*is* evidence about the operator that produced it. Unviables are listed by key
alongside timeouts rather than folded into a summary count — a count gives
nobody a file, an item or an operator to look at.

---

## 6. Scope validity — the refusals

The most valuable thing this loop does is throw sweeps away.

### Stage 0 — the whole run is rejected, exit 3, no partial output

| condition | why |
|---|---|
| the unmutated baseline did not pass | red tree; every verdict is worthless |
| the mutated package owns **zero** test targets and the tested set was not widened | every mutant "survives" a suite that never ran |
| mutants ran and **nothing** was killed | the suite is not exercising this code |
| the census disagrees with the source at a span | the census is stale relative to the tree being triaged |
| the baseline was **skipped** and no green stamp covers this working tree | a skipped baseline on a red tree reports every mutant caught |
| the sweep contains **no mutants at all** | a run that selects nothing exits successfully having tested nothing |

### The sibling-test trap

There is no `.cargo/mutants.toml` in this repo, so `--test-workspace` defaults
to **false**: `just mutants -p <crate>` runs only *that crate's* tests. A domain
crate whose tests live in a sibling use-case crate therefore reports 100%
survivors — a fabricated test-gap avalanche of exactly the shape this loop
exists to eliminate.

`crates/classify-verify-domain` is the live example: 34 mutants, zero
`#[cfg(test)]` files, no `tests/` directory. Its tests live in
`classify-verify` and `classify-verify-agents`. A naive sweep reports 34 of 34
survivors.

```
just mutants-preflight classify-verify-domain     # exits 3 in seconds
```

prints the remedy:

```
just mutants -p classify-verify-domain \
    --test-package classify-verify --test-package classify-verify-agents
```

`classify-verify-domain` is the **regression fixture for this rule, never an
acceptance target**.

### Scope on the census itself

`Cargo.toml` sets `default-members = ["apps/pipe-cli"]`, so an unscoped
`cargo mutants --list` enumerates one app: **19 mutants versus 5295 with
`--workspace`** (both measured 2026-08-03). A ledger key validated against the
19 would be validated against 0.4% of the code, and "no dangling entries" would
mean nothing. `just mutants` and `just mutants-list` therefore **refuse** to run
without an explicit scope (`-p`, `-f`, `-D`, or `--workspace`).

Per the epic's standing rule, never sweep the whole workspace in one run: go
per-crate, per-file, or `--in-diff`.

---

## 7. The deterministic pre-filter

Runs before any agent judgment. Every rule fires with a reported id.

| rule | disposition |
|---|---|
| `verdict/unviable` | quarantine — it never compiled, so it is not evidence about tests |
| `verdict/timeout` | quarantine, re-run queue. Never adjudicated, never admissible |
| `scope/out-of-scope` | invisible to this run |
| `mutation/identical-tokens` | auto-equivalent — normalized `from` == normalized `to`. Re-derived each run, **never written to the ledger** |
| `mutation/default-form` | a duplicate *spelling* of a sibling mutant at the same site, collapsed |
| `ledger/hit` | subtracted — key and item digest both match |
| `ledger/stale` | **not subtracted** — shown with the old justification; needs a fresh refutation |
| `ledger/tombstone` | shown, with why the old verdict was wrong |
| `ledger/dormant` | a ledger entry this sweep did not cover — dormant, not orphaned |
| `sweep/duplicate-key` | collapsed, count surfaced |

Note on `mutation/default-form`: it collapses a duplicate **spelling**, it does
not adjudicate a mutant equivalent to the original. Replacing a body with
`vec![]` is emphatically not equivalent to the body; what *is* mechanical is
that a generator emitting both `vec![]` and `Default::default()` for the same
`-> Vec<T>` emitted one judgment twice. The surviving sibling still faces
judgment.

**Honest accounting.** Almost none of ACH's 0.79 → 0.95 preprocessing lift is
available here as *mechanical equivalence proof*: real mechanically-decidable
equivalents in Rust are rare, and small tightly-written domain crates produce
almost none. The lift here comes from **refusal** (throwing out invalid
sweeps), **quarantine** (timeouts and unviables never reach judgment) and
**clustering**. If this pre-filter is judged on "how many equivalents did it
auto-adjudicate", the honest answer is close to zero, and that is not a failure.

---

## 8. `--ignore-ledger` is a periodic obligation

```
just mutants-triage <crate> --ignore-ledger
```

Re-derives the survivor set from scratch and shows what the ledger is currently
hiding. It is not a debug flag: it is the only answer to a claim invalidated
from a distance — a change somewhere else in the tree that made a
`guarded-unreachable` argument false without touching the anchor or the item.

Run it whenever the crate's callers change shape, and at least whenever you
revisit the crate.

---

## 9. Generator neutrality

The report and ledger schemas are **generator-agnostic**. The planned operator
pack emits into this same pipeline.

> **Law:** a field belongs in the neutral schema only if it can be answered by
> reading the Rust source and the mutant's own diff. If answering it requires
> knowing which tool ran, it is provenance, not schema.

A generator supplies exactly five required things — `path`, `span`, `class`,
`to`, `verdict`. Everything else is optional corroboration or is derived by the
normalizer. Tool-specific payload rides opaquely in `Provenance`, which is
excluded from identity and from the ledger entirely.

Because identity is computed by the domain, **two generators mutating the same
site to the same value produce the same key** — a claim adjudicated under one
generator is honoured under the other, and vice versa.

Two gates hold this up:

- `just hex-lint` makes the *dependency* leak impossible: a domain or usecase
  crate cannot depend on a generator adapter.
- `just mutant-schema-neutral` closes the *vocabulary* leak: it greps the
  neutral core for one tool's name, its output paths, its class field, its
  result words and its two scope flags, and fails on any hit.

The kill-verification **rule** lives in the domain and is the same for every
generator; each adapter contributes only its own **flag traps** through
`KillCommandRenderer::flag_traps`, so a report or a drafted bead can never
instruct its reader to run a different tool's command. Every subcommand that
reads artefacts takes `--generator`, and the renderer is selected per
generator rather than bound once — a renderer pinned to one tool would keep
rendering that tool's flags for every other one, and the mismatch would compile
clean.

Adding the operator pack needs: a new driven-adapter crate with one
`impl SweepSource` and one `impl KillCommandRenderer`, one variant on the CLI's
generator enum (which the compiler then demands in `sweep_source` *and*
`kill_renderer`), and pack fixtures in the domain's conformance corpus. No
change to the ledger file, the filter, the classification convention, or any
existing entry.

## 10. Where the code lives

| crate | role | what it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `mutation-triage-domain` | `domain` | identity, the ledger entities and their integrity rules, the pre-filter, the ports. No I/O, no generator vocabulary |
| `mutation-triage` | `usecase` | Stage 0 refusal, the sweep-to-report pipeline, ledger admission / re-affirmation / revocation |
| `cargo-mutants-report` | `driven-adapter` | the only crate that may name cargo-mutants, and the one that knows what it never mutates |
| `mutation-triage-fs` | `driven-adapter` | the ledger's TOML format, source reading, the test-target inventory, bead resolution |
| `mutants-triage-cli` | `composition-root` | the `mutants-triage` binary and the wiring |
